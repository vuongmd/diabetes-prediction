<h1>Diabetes Prediction Using KNN, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest</h1>

This project demonstrates the use of pipelines to demonstrate testing K-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, and random forest models to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes. This project also demonstrates the use of cross validation, feature selection, data normalization, and hyperparameter tuning.
